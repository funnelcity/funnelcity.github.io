I just setup standalone zurb foundation 4 + jekyll.rb on funnel city's website. This task had been on my to do list for quite a while now and I am really glad to cross it off my to-do list today! 

I'm still not completely done with it, I still have to port over the page with the slider and contact form.

I'm loving the much needed mobile first approach taken to revamp the framework. It is definitely a lot easier to use than version 3.
