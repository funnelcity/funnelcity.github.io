zurb Foundation 4 + jekyll.rb  has been setup on funnel city's public website. This task had been on the to do list for quite a while now and it is really exciting to cross it off the list today! 

The site is still under construction, the slider and contact form need to be ported over.

The mobile first approach taken to revamp the zurb Foundation framework is awesome. It is definitely a lot easier to use than version 3 for sure.
